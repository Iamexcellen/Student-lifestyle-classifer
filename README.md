<h1>**‘Student Lifestyle Clustering App’**</h1>
---
##This project uses **K-Means clustering** to classify different types of student lifestyles based on daily habits and academic indicators.<br>

👉 **Live Demo（right now it is in Chinese version)**<br>
Here is the link for experiencing<br>
https://genesisthebeginning.streamlit.app/<br>

##**The technology that I used:**<br>
- Python
- Streamlit
- scikit-learn（KMeans, StandardScaler）
- pandas, numpy
---
##**The introduction of the dataset:**<br>
"student_lifestyle_dataset.csv" is the dataset that I am using.<br>
The main variables are:<br>
- Study_Hours_Per_Day  
- Extracurricular_Hours_Per_Day  
- Sleep_Hours_Per_Day  
- Social_Hours_Per_Day  
- Physical_Activity_Hours_Per_Day  
- GPA  
- Stress_Level（Low / Moderate / High change to 1 / 2 / 3）

##**The function of the project:**<br>
-Users could choose their own lifestyle indicators
- The project automatically standardizes inputs using **StandardScaler**  
- A **K-Means model (k = 3)** is used to classify the lifestyle type  
- The app returns a cluster label representing different student lifestyle categories

##**Purpose**<br>
This web app provides a simple and interactive demonstration of how machine learning can be used to cluster behavioral patterns.
